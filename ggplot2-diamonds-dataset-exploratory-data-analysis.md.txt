# Introduction

One of the [Udacity Data Analysis with R Problem Set][1] requires us to investigate the price of diamonds using box plots, numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical variables: cut, clarity, and color. The problem set uses the [dimaond dataset][2] within the R ggplot2 package.

A nice thing about the Udacity problem set is that it comes with some very useful forums where students get to share their findings and approaches on things like how they explore and analyze the data, and how they came up conclusions. Other students (including me) may then be inspired by other's approaches and try attempt-improving these further to gain further **insights**.

As I started exploring and analyzing the `diamonds` dataset in R, I gradually discovered some pretty intersting patterns and some pretty cool techniques. More importantly, I learnt about asking small questions which may help unlocking that **insight**.

The aim of this **Exploratory Data Analysis** is to **understand** the `diamonds` dataset and unlock **insights**. It turns out that **asking good questions** help.
